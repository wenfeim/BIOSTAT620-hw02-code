## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


*Problem 2*
*(a)Note that each regression model may have its own set of covariates. Report the estimates of the model parameters from the R output*
```{r}
library("readxl")
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/windu/Desktop/620hw02 data source.xlsx")

library("systemfit")
```


```{r}

data$Y2_lag <- c(NA, head(data$Social.ST.min, -1))
fit <- systemfit(list(Total.ST.min ~ Y1_lag + Xt + Zt, Social.ST.min ~ Y2_lag + Xt + Zt), data = data, method = "SUR")
summary(fit)
